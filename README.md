# ☕ Java Mastery Journey 🚀

Welcome! This is my personal roadmap to becoming a Java developer. I am following a structured path from absolute basics to advanced programming concepts.

## 📌 My Learning Roadmap
I'm mastering Java in these specific phases (excluding DBMS to focus purely on the language and logic):

### 🟢 Phase 1: Java Fundamentals
* **The Basics**: Variables, Data Types, and Type Casting.
* **Operators**: Arithmetic, Logical, and Bitwise operations.
* **Flow Control**: Mastering `if-else`, `switch`, and various `Loops`.
* **Strings & Arrays**: Manipulating text and data collections.

### 🔵 Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
* **Core Pillars**: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
* **Class Design**: Constructors, `this` vs `super`, and Access Modifiers.
* **Advanced OOP**: Abstract Classes and Interfaces.

### 🟣 Phase 3: Advanced Core Java
* **Exception Handling**: Using `try-catch`, `throw`, and `finally` to build robust code.
* **Collections Framework**: Deep dive into `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and `Sets`.
* **Multithreading**: Learning how to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
* **Java 8 Features**: Lambda Expressions and the Stream API.
